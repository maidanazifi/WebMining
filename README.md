## Abstract 
  We introduce various algorithms for Web Content Mining task - namely, Named Entity Recognition. We start by justifying the importance of this task in the current situation of growing requirements for businesses according to GDPR, proceed with short introduction and analysis of data set acquired and then discuss in detail all implemented algorithms. The ultimate goal of this project is to obtain practical and domain-independent techniques in order to detect named entities with high accuracy.
  In the course of reading one can regard self-tuned BERT and FNNs with combination of LSTM layers with different common algorithms for Named Entity Recognition, such as CRF, CNN and RNN, to be most suitable for obtaining high performance in the task.
  Our experiments and analyses raised the idea that also in Named Entity Recognition tasks there may exist an unavoidable trade-off between the running time of the algorithm (speed) and performance level this algorithm exhibits.
